Pole Optimizer is a GIS-based solution designed to optimize pole placements using geospatial data and shortest-path algorithms. This project was inspired by research into **network planning and optimization**, where efficient infrastructure placement was explored.


# Pole Optimizer App

### Overview
Pole Optimizer is a GIS-based solution designed to optimize pole placements using geospatial data and shortest-path algorithms. This project was inspired by research into **network planning and optimization**, where efficient infrastructure placement was explored.

### Features
✅ **Upload CSV location data**  
✅ **Optimize pole placements using shortest-path analysis**  
✅ **Integrate geospatial calculations with population density mapping**  
✅ **Generate structured output for GIS systems**  

### Technologies Used
- **Flask** for backend processing  
- **NetworkX** for shortest-path calculations  
- **Geopy** for geospatial distance computations  
- **Pandas** for CSV data handling  

### How to Use
1️⃣ Upload **CSV** with latitude/longitude coordinates  
2️⃣ App applies **shortest-path logic** for pole optimization  
3️⃣ Optimized locations are returned in **JSON or CSV format**  

### Background & Motivation
This project was developed based on **network optimization principles**, integrating **real-world geospatial planning** to create an efficient pole placement system.
